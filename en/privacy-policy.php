        <h3>2. Terms and Legal Bases</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Terms</h4>
        <p>
            Personal data are all details related to an identified or identifiable natural person. An affected person is an individual whose personal data we process.
            <br><br>
            Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of the means and procedures used, such as querying, matching, adjusting, archiving, storing, reading, disclosing, obtaining, capturing, collecting, deleting, revealing, arranging, organizing, storing, modifying, distributing, linking, destroying, and using personal data.
        </p>
        <h4>2.2 Legal Bases</h4>
        <p>
            We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law, particularly the Federal Act on Data Protection (Data Protection Act, DPA) and the Ordinance on Data Protection (Data Protection Ordinance, DPO).
        </p>

        <h3>3. Type, Scope, and Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            We process personal data that are necessary to carry out our activities and operations in a permanent, user-friendly, secure, and reliable manner. Such personal data may fall into categories such as inventory and contact data, browser and device data, content data, meta or marginal data, usage data, location data, sales data, as well as contract and payment data.
            <br><br>
            We process personal data for the duration necessary for the respective purpose or purposes or as required by law. Personal data that are no longer necessary for processing are anonymized or deleted.
            <br><br>
            We may have personal data processed by third parties. We may process personal data together with third parties or transmit it to third parties. Such third parties are particularly specialized providers whose services we use. We also ensure data protection with such third parties.
            <br><br>
            We process personal data only with the consent of the affected person, unless the processing is permitted for other legal reasons. Processing without consent can be permissible, for example, to fulfill a contract with the affected person and for corresponding pre-contractual measures, to protect our overriding legitimate interests, because processing is evident from the circumstances, or after prior information.
            <br><br>
            In this context, we process in particular data that an affected person voluntarily transmits to us during contact – for example, by mail, email, instant messaging, contact form, social media, or telephone – or during registration for a user account. We can store such data in an address book or with similar tools. If we receive data about other people, the transmitting persons are obliged to ensure data protection towards these people and to ensure the accuracy of this personal data.
            <br><br>
            We also process personal data that we receive from third parties, obtain from publicly accessible sources, or collect in the exercise of our activities and operations, provided and to the extent that such processing is legally permissible.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Personal Data Abroad</h3>
        <p>
            We generally process personal data in Switzerland. However, we can also disclose or export personal data to other countries, particularly to process it there or have it processed.
            <br><br>
            We can disclose personal data to any state and territory on Earth and elsewhere in the universe, provided that the law there guarantees adequate data protection according to the decision of the Swiss Federal Council.
            <br><br>
            We can disclose personal data to states whose law does not guarantee adequate data protection, provided there are other reasons for adequate data protection. Adequate data protection can be ensured, for example, by appropriate contractual agreements, based on standard data protection clauses, or with other suitable guarantees. Exceptionally, we can export personal data to states without adequate or suitable data protection if the special data protection requirements are met, for example, the express consent of the affected persons or a direct connection with the conclusion or handling of a contract. We gladly provide information about any guarantees to affected persons upon request or deliver a copy of guarantees.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Rights of Affected Persons</h3>
        <h4>5.1 Data Protection Claims</h4>
        <p>
            We grant affected persons all claims according to applicable data protection law. Affected persons have the following rights in particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Information: Affected persons can request information about whether we process personal data about them, and if so, what personal data. Affected persons also receive the information necessary to assert their data protection rights and ensure transparency. This includes the processed personal data as such, but also information about the processing purpose, the duration of storage, any disclosure or export of data to other states, and the origin of the personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Correction and Restriction: Affected persons can correct inaccurate personal data, complete incomplete data, and restrict the processing of their data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deletion and Objection: Affected persons can have personal data deleted ("right to be forgotten") and object to the processing of their data with effect for the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data Release and Data Transfer: Affected persons can request the release of personal data or the transfer of their data to another controller.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may postpone, limit, or refuse the exercise of the rights of affected persons within the legally permissible framework. We can point out to affected persons any conditions that must be met to exercise their data protection rights. For example, we can refuse to provide information with reference to business secrets or the protection of other persons, wholly or partially. We can also refuse the deletion of personal data with reference to statutory retention obligations, wholly or partially.
            <br><br>
            We may foresee costs for the exercise of rights exceptionally. We inform affected persons in advance about any costs.
            <br><br>
            We are obliged to identify affected persons who request information or assert other rights with reasonable measures. Affected persons are required to cooperate.
        </p>
        <h4>5.2 Right to Complaint</h4>
        <p>
            Affected persons have the right to enforce their data protection claims in court or file a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.
            <br><br>
            The data protection supervisory authority for private controllers and federal bodies in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).
        </p>

        <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
        <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data security appropriate to the respective risk. However, we cannot guarantee absolute data security.
            <br><br>
            Access to our website is via transport encryption (SSL / TLS, especially with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, abbreviated HTTPS). Most browsers indicate transport encryption with a padlock in the address bar.
            <br><br>
            Our digital communication – like generally any digital communication – is subject to mass surveillance without cause or suspicion and other surveillance by security authorities in Switzerland, the rest of Europe, the United States of America (USA), and other states. We cannot directly influence the corresponding processing of personal data by secret services, police stations, and other security authorities.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Use of the Website</h3>
        <h4>7.1 Cookies</h4>
        <p>
            We may use cookies. Cookies – both our own (First-Party-Cookies) and those of third parties whose services we use (Third-Party-Cookies) – are data stored in the browser. Such stored data need not be limited to traditional text-form cookies.
            <br><br>
            Cookies can be stored in the browser temporarily as "Session Cookies" or for a specific period as so-called permanent cookies. "Session Cookies" are automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Permanent cookies have a specific storage duration. Cookies, in particular, enable a browser to be recognized upon the next visit to our website, thereby allowing us to measure, for example, the reach of our website. Permanent cookies can also be used for online marketing, for instance.
            <br><br>
            Cookies can be completely or partially deactivated and deleted in the browser settings at any time. Without cookies, our website may not be fully available. We request – at least as far as necessary – explicit consent for the use of cookies.
            <br><br>
            For cookies used for success and reach measurement or for advertising, a general objection ("Opt-out") is possible for many services via AdChoices (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada), the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), YourAdChoices (Digital Advertising Alliance), or Your Online Choices (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, EDAA).
        </p>
        <h4>7.2 Server Log Files</h4>
        <p>
            For each access to our website, we may collect the following information, provided it is transmitted by your browser to our server infrastructure or can be determined by our web server: date and time including time zone, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access status (HTTP status code), operating system including interface and version, browser including language and version, individual sub-page of our website accessed including the amount of data transferred, and the last webpage accessed in the same browser window (referer or referrer).
            <br><br>
            We store such information, which can also constitute personal data, in server log files. This information is necessary to provide our website permanently, user-friendly, and reliably and to ensure data security and thus particularly the protection of personal data – even by third parties or with the help of third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
            We use services from specialized third parties to be able to carry out our activities and operations permanently, user-friendly, securely, and reliably. With such services, we can embed functions and content into our website. For technical reasons, the services used temporarily capture the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of users during such embedding.
            <br><br>
            For necessary security-related, statistical, and technical purposes, third parties whose services we use may process data related to our activities and operations in an aggregated, anonymized, or pseudonymized manner. These include, for example, performance or usage data to provide the respective service.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use in particular: <br>
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Services of Google</a><br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h4>8.1 Digital Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>
            We use services from specialized third parties to avail of the required digital infrastructure in connection with our activities and operations. This includes, for example, hosting and storage services from selected providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use in particular: <br>
            <a href="https://www.hostpoint.ch/hostpoint/contact-agb.html#datenschutz">Services of Hostpoint AG</a><br>
            <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">Services of GitHub</a><br>
        </p>
        <h4>8.2 Fonts</h4>
        <p>
            We use services from third parties to embed selected fonts as well as icons, logos, and symbols into our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use in particular: <br>
            <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/en/a/font/legal/website-use-privacy-policy">Services of My Fonts</a><br>
        </p>

        <h3>9. Website Extensions</h3>
        <p>
            We use extensions for our website to be able to use additional functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use in particular: <br>
            <a href="https://jquery.com/">Services of jQuery (OpenJS Foundation)</a><br>
        </p>

        <h3>10. Success and Reach Measurement</h3>
        <p>
            We use services and programs to determine how our online offering is used. In this context, we can, for example, measure the success and reach of our activities and operations as well as the impact of third-party links on our website. We can also test and compare how different versions of our online offer or parts of our online offer are used (using the "A/B test" method). Based on the results of the success and reach measurement, we can, in particular, fix errors, strengthen popular content, or make improvements to our online offer.
            <br><br>
            When using services and programs for success and reach measurement, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of individual users must be stored. IP addresses are generally shortened ("IP masking") to follow the principle of data economy through appropriate pseudonymization, thus improving the data protection of users.
            <br><br>
            When using services and programs for success and reach measurement, cookies may be used, and user profiles may be created. User profiles include, for example, visited pages or viewed content on our website, information about the size of the screen or browser window, and the – at least approximate – location. User profiles are generally created exclusively in a pseudonymized form. We do not use user profiles to identify individual users. Individual third-party services, where users are registered, may associate the use of our online offer with the user account or user profile at the respective service.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Final Provisions</h3>
        <p>
            We may adjust and supplement this privacy policy at any time. We will inform about such adjustments and supplements in an appropriate manner, especially by publishing the current privacy policy on our website.
